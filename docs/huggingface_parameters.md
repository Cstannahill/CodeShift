# HuggingFace Fine-Tuning Parameters

This reference explains common optional arguments used when fine-tuning models with the HuggingFace `transformers` library. Adjust these parameters to influence training behavior and model quality.

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `learning_rate` | Step size for the optimizer. Smaller values often produce more stable training but require more epochs. |
| `num_train_epochs` | Number of passes over the training dataset. More epochs allow the model to fit better but may lead to overfitting. |
| `per_device_train_batch_size` | Batch size for each device (GPU/CPU). Larger batches make training faster but consume more memory. |
| `warmup_steps` | Number of steps during which the learning rate increases linearly from zero to its initial value. Helps stabilize training. |
| `weight_decay` | Strength of L2 regularization to prevent large weights and overfitting. |
| `gradient_accumulation_steps` | Effective batch size multiplier by accumulating gradients over multiple steps. Useful when GPU memory is limited. |
| `logging_steps` | Frequency of logging metrics. Higher values reduce I/O overhead. |
| `evaluation_strategy` | When to run evaluation (`"no"`, `"steps"`, `"epoch"`). Enables early feedback during training. |
| `save_strategy` | When to save checkpoints (`"steps"` or `"epoch"`). Frequent checkpoints allow recovery from failures but use more disk space. |
| `fp16` | Use 16-bit floating point precision for faster training on supported hardware. |

Adjust these according to the dataset size and hardware capabilities. For more details, see the [HuggingFace documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/trainer#transformers.TrainingArguments).
